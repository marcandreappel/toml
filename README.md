Devium\Toml
===========

A robust and efficient PHP library for encoding and decoding [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml)
compatible with [TOML v1.0.0](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0)

> This library tries to support the TOML specification as much as possible.

## Overview

This library provides a comprehensive solution for working with TOML in PHP applications

## Features

- Encoding PHP arrays and objects to TOML format
- Decoding TOML strings into PHP data structures
- Preserves data types as specified in TOML
- Handles complex nested structures
- Supports TOML datetime formats
- Error handling with informative messages

## Installation

You can install this library via composer:

```shell
composer require devium/toml
```

## Usage

Decoding:

```php
$toml = <<<TOML

# This is a TOML document

title = "TOML Example"

[owner]
name = "Tom Preston-Werner"
dob = 1979-05-27T07:32:00-08:00

TOML;

dump(\Devium\Toml\Toml::decode($toml, asArray: true));
dump(\Devium\Toml\Toml::decode($toml, asArray: false));

// or use global helper
dump(toml_decode($toml, asArray: false));
dump(toml_decode($toml, asArray: true));
```

Encoding:

```php
$data = [
  "title" => "TOML Example",
  "owner" => [
    "name" => "Tom Preston-Werner",
    "dob" => "1979-05-27T15:32:00.000Z",
  ],
];

dump(\Devium\Toml\Toml::encode($data));
// or use global helper
dump(toml_encode($data));
```
